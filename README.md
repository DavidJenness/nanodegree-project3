Project 3 - Classic Arcade Game Clone
===============================

This project emulates a classic arcade game similar to Frogger.
Your goal is to use the arrow keys to navigate across the board to get to the blue water zone which is safe from the bug infestation.

You need to avoid being struck by one of the bugs or else you will be sent back to the starting position.

You will not be able to move off of the sides or bottom of the map.

To run the game, simply go to this URL.
